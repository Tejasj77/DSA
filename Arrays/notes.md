```js
if (!arr2Item || arr1Item < arr2Item) {
}
```

> In if() we have added "!arr2Item" because if after iteration arr2 is finished, we want to push only arr1 items in the merged array.

```js
else{}
```

> We do not require "!arr1Item" because if arr1 is over first, then anyway else block will run and arr2 items will be pushed in the mergedArray.
